* Each question should be saved in a separate file
* The name of the file is at the bottom of each question

# 1. Introduction to String Theory

Write a JavaScript program that displays the following 

    
    JavaScript is fun.
    It even has multiline functionality.
    Case in point, the answer to this question
    should display the functionality elegantly
    

The program should
 * use just one console.log
 * Only 1 argument should be passed to  the console.log


#### file: 0-string_theory.js

# 2. Intermediate String Theory

Write a JavaScript Program that displays the following:

    
    You can't \n\nescape this
    
The program should
* use one console.log

#### file: 1-string_theory.js

# 3. Advanced String Theory

Write the following javascript program:
 * declare a variable myValue and assign it a value of 37
 * declare another variable otherValue and assign it a value of 73
 * display the sum of myValue and otherValue
 * Your program should be 3 lines of code (3 loc) long
 * Your program should use one console.log
 * The console.log should have 1 argument only
 * The output should be exactly as shown

    ```
    The sum is: 110
    ```

#### file: 2-string_theory.js

# 4. I, Operator

Write the following JavaScript Program

* Declare a variable value using the let keyword
* Assign a value of 37 to value
* Find the type of value
* console.log should display:

    ```
    string
    ```

The program should
 * have two typeof operators
 * be 2 loc (lines of code) long
 * have one console.log

# 6. When Strings Unite

Write a JavaScript program that displays the
following using the + operator

    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

The program should:
* have 2 '+' operators


# 5. String Theory revisited

Write a JavaScript program that displays the following:

    JavaScript is fun.
    It even has multiline functionality.
    Case in point, this question's answer
        should display the functionality elegantly

# 6. Strings are neither created nor destroyed, but can be converted from one form to another

Write the following script:
* declare a variable, value and assign to it
the string 79
* declare another variable value2 and assign to it
97
* declare a third variable result
* declare a fourth variable result2
* assign to result2 the value of value+value2
* convert the variable value to a number and re-assign the converted variable to value
* assign to result the sum of value and value2
* Using console.log:
   -    display the value of result
   -    display the data type of result
   -    display the value of result2
   -    display the data type of result2

#### file: 7-conversion.js

# 7. Math 101
Write the following script:

* Declare two variables a and b and assign to them the values 8 and 6 respectively.
* declare 3 variables:
    -   min, to which you'll assign the minimum between the two numbers
    -   max, to which you'll assign the maximum between the two numbers
    -   hypotenuse, to which you'll assign the hypotenuse between a and b

* Use the Math object to find
    - the minimum between the two numbers
    - the maximum between the two numbers
    - the hypotenuse given a is the base and b is the height of a right-angled triangle
    - b raised to the power of a
    - base2 logarithm of a
    - base10 logarithm of b

* Find a raised to the power of b using the          exponentiation (**) operator

* For 6 raised to the power of 8, you should pass one
argument only to console.log

* For base2 logarithm of 8, you should pass two arguments to console.log
* For base10 logarithm of 6:
    - you should pass 3 arguments to console.log
    - you should use a decimal format specifier and
    a floating-point format specifier

* Use console.log to display the results.
* This how the end-result of the script should look like:

    ```
    6 raised to the power of 8 is: 1679616
    8 raised to the power of 6 is: 262144
    base2 logarithm of 8 is:  3
    base10 logarithm of 6 is: 2.584962500721156
    The minimum is:  6
    The maximum is:  8
    The hypotenuse is:  10

    ```
